# Fuse
A WIP split, 60%, wireless, low profile, choc spaced, magnetic keyboard. 

## Design Notes

* 3D printed case with embedded magnets to allow the two split boards to snap together into a single board. 
* Switches must be soldered as the footprint of hotswap sockets would space the switches too far apart.
* Through hole diode matrix as they look badass and SMD parts are a pain to solder. 
* Wireless (no TRRS), Nice!Nano with 3.7v batteries. Power Switch on PCB.
* PCBs are reversible for the left / right hand. Nice!Nano pins mirrored in ZMK firmware.
